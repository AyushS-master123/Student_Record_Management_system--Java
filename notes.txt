We can access private variables,methods from other class by get-set method.
Private variables are accessible in the same class.
.class file contains the class code in binary format(010101)
javac firstprogram.java=javac means java compiler so this command converts all the classes present in the firstprogram.java file into binary format which is present in .class file 
java world=we use java world command because class world has the main method and the program starts executing from the main method.
(this) keyword is object which is used to access the variables inside the class.
